# Local-Post-Training-Stack---Fine-tuning-LLMs-with-Safety-Filters
Build a compact, reproducible post-training stack that takes a pre-trained small language model, applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a simple RLHF/constraint loop (simulated), and produces a model with improved helpfulness and safety scores.
